# *Mouse Jiggler*
#Mouse Jiggler is an application that simulates mouse movements to prevent the computer from going into sleep mode or locking the screen due to inactivity. It is often used by people who need to keep their computer active for long periods of time without interacting with it. Mouse Jiggler can be configured to jiggle the mouse at different intervals.
